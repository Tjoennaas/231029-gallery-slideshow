          <p>Meet Edvin, a 13 years old Leopard Gecko from Oslo, -a good friend.
            His ancestors are likely Pakistanis, you can tell that from his skin coloration
            as the different varieties of patterns originally are each endemic to a specific area.
            He also has relatives in Afganistan, India, Iran and Nepal - all with slightly different body art
            native to their region.</p>

          <p>Although he can live relatively free now, take a walk in the park or go to the doctor if needed,
            -even get away an a holiday once in a while, it hasn’t always been that way.
            Edvin was born as an illegal citizen. Until aug. 15. 2017, Norway had practiced (from 1977)
            the strictest laws regarding exotic herptiles in the world -along with Iceland- with a total ban.
            There where underground networks all over, and an estimated total of 100.000 animals or more -the
            law where ignored to such degree they decided to remove it, replacing it with a short list of permitted
            species: the Positive List.</p>

          <p>Edvin doesn’t speak latin, or any other human language, 
            only Gecko -which is more like guttural sounds, but thats not stopping him from having a latin name: 
            Eublepharis macularius (actually some of it is greek which is even harder!),
             basically meaning he has good eye lids and spots. Very informative,
              you might think, but almost no geckos have eyelids (!), they just lick themselves in the eyes once in a while. 
              He is also one of the very few with claws instead of lamellas on his toes, 
              meaning he can’t climb glass and such- to his enormously big frustration.</p>

          <p>You can get the impression that Edvin lives in a simple aquarium,
             or Terrarium (terra meaning earth or soil in latin or whatever), 
             but the fact is that it’s carefully buildt, 
             balanced and calibrated to mimic his natural habitat in desert highlands and cliffy mountains in Pakistan, 
             in which they tend to live in rather small territories, 
             they basically sit on a rock or in front of a cave, saying «This is MY Rock!»,
            with a harem of girls and very seldom move for any where else.
             Actually an important reason for why they do so good in cages in Oslo, where space is limited.</p>

            The light (UVA,UVB), humidity and temperature ranges in all combinations so he can always hang out in the optimal spot, 
            only disturbed by the occasional nutritious snack,
            just like in nature (btw he also eats spiders and cockroaches, nasty!).
            A lot of petstores will say «this is overkill, go fore a more basic setup!» When you see him thrive,
            you’ll know that’s a lie. Picture yourself in Bali, 
            nice surroundings, good food. Then picture Oslo in november, with only old bread to eat.

            Nowadays, breeders have learned to manipulate the genes controlling color and patterns in Leopard geckos allmost
            to the full (-you guessed it, same genes that causes the endemic patterns in nature), 
            and you can get yourself a white, black, yellow, albino, orange, 
            stripy or bald or any other weird looking variety of a gecko friend.
            Edvins twist however, is a bit more special. He’s a giant.
            A Tremper`s Giant to be accurate, named after an American breeder. 
             Meaning when his friends walk around, 
             being only 25cm, he is over 30. The natural boss of everyone: a bit like Godzilla.
