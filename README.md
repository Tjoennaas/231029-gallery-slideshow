«Edvin» is a school assignment where I made a presentation of our pet lizard to illustrate a image slideshow in which you can scroll through the images by clicking the image itself, with the <- -> keys, and by swiping left/right on a cellphone. It also got dedicated buttons for next/previous image- and at last buttons for navigating to a specific image. Its a short more or less informational text to each image.

Status: Under development, but stable as it is now. Did not get the scrolling function working, as I tried combining it with buttons. Although I didn’t manage in this assignment I ve gotten close to a solution to the problem and planning on getting this working and integrated in later assignments.

Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Responsive design: compatible with all devices.

Browser support: No known issues.

Links and references: Mainly based on/inspired by various tutorials on the specific subjects from YouTube, with modifications and adjustments made to fit my project. Some I have lost, unfortunately, here’s the rest:
