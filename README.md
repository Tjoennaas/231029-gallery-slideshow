«ComponentLibrary» is a school assignment in which I was to let myself be inspired from existing design systems to make my own component library with at least 10 components. The sketches are drawn in Figma, before programmed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make it dynamic and interactive. The point is for me to have a living library of components to use wherever suited.

Responsive design: Tried my best but didn’t make it work on the smaller screens. OK on bigger sized.

Status: Working and stabile.

Browser support: No known issues.
